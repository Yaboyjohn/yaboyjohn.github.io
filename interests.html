    <div id="paragraph-wrapper">
      <p id="first-paragraph">As I'm sure you can tell already, competitive swimming is been one of my <br>favorite pasttimes
      and has been a sport that has played a huge part in my <br>life. I started swimming competitively when I was 9 years old for BREA Aquatics in
      Walnut, California. While there, I had great success and many personal achievements including ranking #12 in
      Southern California for the 100 yard Breastroke and also being a member of the relay team that broke several
      club records. I would continue swimming all through high school, being on Diamond Bar High School's varsity team
      for 4 years and also competing at the Southern Section CIF Divison II meet for two of those years. While all of
      these personal achievements were great, it was what swimmming taught me outside of the pool that I treasure the most.</p>
      <p> This brings me to the quote on the picture, spoken by one of my first coaches, Conway Yeo. He was notorious
        for being one of the most challenging and intimidating coaches on the team, so when he extended me an offer
        to join his group, it was only natural that I was hesitant at first. But, looking back now, that was one of the best decisions
        I ever made. Almost every day, I found myself sore and sometimes dreading
        what practices he had in store for us. He demanded the most from his swimmers- hard work, dedication, the drive to improve.
        Under his instruction, I had the best swims of my career and even now, after I have left the sport, I still
        find the principles he taught guiding me everyday. I recall one race where I was seeded in lane 3, which in swimming meant that
        you were next to the fastest guy in the entire heat. Before the race even began, I was extremely nervous. I kept
        glancing at the guy next to me and I kept wondering if I could even compete with him. When the race finally started,
        I kept looking to my right and seeing if I was keeping up with him. I seemed to be staying neck to neck
        with him, then right when we turned into the last half, things fell apart. I felt weak. It was hard to move my arms, hard to kick my legs, and bit by bit,
        I fell behind. I ended up finishing nearly last in the entire heat and I felt ashamed of myself for how poorly I swam.
        Afterwards when I went to talk to Coach Conway about the race, he said to me words that I will never forget and he said it to me in a way only he could. "Why the hell were you looking at the guy next
        to you so much!? Swim your own race!" These words especially spoke to me because personally, I've never been great at anything. I've always been with others
        who were far superior than I was and often times I found myself trying so hard to do things the way they did. After this race, I realized that even though I may
        not be as talented or as smart as those around me, I can still compete with the best of them. This has been one of the guiding principles in my life, and
        I honestly wouldn't be where I am now without all these years of swimming and Coach Conway's instruction. So if you ever read this one day Coach Conway. I just want to say thank you, for everything.</p>

      <p id="ball-paragraph">The words above say it all. Aside from swimming,
        basketball was my favorite sport to play with friends. Growing up in LA and
        watching my favorite player Kobe Bryant inspired me to get out there and get buckets.
        Whether it was at school playing with friends or going hard in a pickup game at the local park,
        I always enjoyed the teamwork needed to win and the competitiveness the sport demanded.
        Plus, it's always nice to cross up your friend and drain the pull up jumper in his face.</h3>
